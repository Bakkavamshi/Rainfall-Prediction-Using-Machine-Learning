# Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project focuses on predicting rainfall using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical weather data, the goal is to build a model that accurately predicts whether rainfall will occur on a given day. The model uses weather-related features such as temperature, humidity, and pressure to make predictions.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
- Predict the occurrence of rainfall based on historical weather data.
- Explore and apply machine learning algorithms for weather forecasting.
- Provide valuable insights for weather prediction and related applications, such as agriculture and disaster management.

## How It Works
This project follows the steps below to achieve accurate rainfall predictions:

1. **Data Collection**: Historical weather data is gathered, including key features like temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and features are standardized to ensure uniformity.
3. **Model Selection**: Various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest are tested for performance.
4. **Model Training**: The chosen model is trained on the dataset, and hyperparameters are tuned for better performance.
5. **Model Evaluation**: The model’s performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to ensure it’s suitable for prediction.
6. **Prediction**: The trained model is then used to predict rainfall on unseen data.

## Installation
